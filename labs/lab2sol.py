print("The value of y**x is: z =",z) # printing z value

z = round(z, 3) # rounding z to 3 decimal places and storing it in z

print("The value of z rounded to 3 decimal places =",z) # printing z

print("The absolute value of z is:",abs(z)) # printing the absolute value of z

result = (x*y + 7)/(x + y) # Assigning result to the equation

print("The result rounded to nearest integer is:",round(result)) # printing rounded result
